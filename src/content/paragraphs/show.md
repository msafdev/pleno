Want to showcase your latest work, education, or anything else? It’s as simple as editing a single file.

Just open [`/constants.ts`](../constants.ts) and add a new item to the relevant array. No CMS, no config, no database — just clean, editable code.

Define your content in one place, and the template takes care of the rest.
